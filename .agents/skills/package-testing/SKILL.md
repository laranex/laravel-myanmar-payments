# Package Testing

## Primary Goal

Prove package behavior with Pest 4/5, Orchestra Testbench, and the local `tests/TestCase.php` setup before or alongside implementation.

## Workflow

1. Start with TDD: write the smallest failing package test for the requested behavior, then implement the smallest change that makes it pass.
2. Cover happy-path, unhappy-path, and edge-case behavior when the feature has meaningful failure modes.
3. Prefer focused feature tests for package integration behavior and arch tests for broad constraints.
4. Use `composer test:unit -- --filter ...` while iterating, `composer test:types` when type-sensitive tests or code changed, and `composer test` before finishing.
5. Keep real package tests in the suite and remove only throwaway tests that were explicitly created for local scaffolding experiments.

- `tests/ArchTest.php`
- `composer.json` scripts

## Examples

- Test config merge and config override by asserting default package config, then overriding the host config value in the Testbench app.
- Test publishable assets, migrations, views, lang files, or config by invoking vendor publish behavior and asserting the target path exists.
- Test routes with Testbench HTTP requests, commands with Artisan assertions, migrations with a SQLite test database, and workbench behavior after `composer build` when needed.

## Anti-Patterns

- Deleting real package tests because they are inconvenient.
- Relying only on smoke tests when behavior needs assertions.
- Testing implementation details when observable package behavior is available.
- Keeping throwaway scaffolding experiment tests in the package test suite.
